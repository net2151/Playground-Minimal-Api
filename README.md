# Minimal API Playground
A place I'm trying out the new ASP.NET Core minimal APIs for hosting and HTTP APIs.

## Dependencies
Code in this repo depends on the very latest bits (not even in official previews). If you want to try it out, [grab the latest .NET SDK installer](https://github.com/dotnet/installer#installers-and-binaries).
